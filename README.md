## More

This theme is a take on Tidal's UI, with colors ripped straight from the app. I've also removed a bunch of the uppercase text only including it on tabs. I've also made a few adjustments to Artist pages (the monthly listeners and followers), as well as playlist pages (the followers label)

All artists are represented with square images rather than circles, and the same with users.
